A powerful Python-based toolkit for hash generation and hash recovery that supports all major hash algorithms.
Built for developers, cybersecurity learners, and penetration testers, this tool lets you quickly create hashes for any text and attempt to recover them using wordlists or brute-force methods.

Key Features

Full algorithm support: MD5, SHA family (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512), plus extendable support for other algorithms via Python's hashlib.

Two-way functionality:

Encrypt: Generate hashes for any input text instantly.

Decrypt: Attempt recovery using dictionary attacks or short-length brute-force.


Fast & Lightweight: Uses only Python's built-in libraries ‚Äî no extra dependencies.

Educational Mode: Clear structure and safe defaults for learning purposes.

Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
